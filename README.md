# FMY-001V - Fundamentos de Machine Learning

In this repo I'll be documenting my progress on FMY-001V "Fundamentos de Machine Learning" course at Duoc UC.

There will be a folder for every "Actividad" (Activity) which will contain:
- Assignment file, usually .pdf file. If there is no PDF file assumme Colab file as Assignment
- Colab file, usually .ipynb
- Dataset file. If there is no file, assumme that the Colab file has the data integrated already.
